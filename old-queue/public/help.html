		<p>
			Teachers are in charge of specific queues. In addition to the privileges of an assistant,
			they can also add and remove assistants as well as teachers from their queues and <a href="/#/help#hide">hide</a> or <a href="/#/help#removeQueue">remove</a> the queue itself.

		<h2 id="assistant" style="margin-top: 0;">Assistants</h2>

		<p>
			Queue assistants help with moderating specific queues. In addition to removing specific users,
			they are also able to lock and <a href="/#/help#purge">purge</a> queues, as well as sending messages and interact with the users in the queue.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>
				Note: All the assistants privileges are located in the queue. You get there by choosing the right queue from the list of <a href="/#/list">queues</a>.
			</em>
		</p>

		<h3 id="kick">Kicking a user</h3>
		<p>
			To remove a queue position, first double-click the user you wish to remove and thereafter click the appering red button with a cross on it. Be careful when removing users from the queue, as this action can not be reverted.
		</p>
		<img src="" alt="Add a picture">

			</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			By helping a user, you mark them using the green button with a checkmark accessed in the same way as you would access the button to <a href="/#/help#kick">kick</a> someone.
			When a user is receiving help, they will start pulsing, notifing any other assistant that they can move to the next person in the queue.
		</p>

		<h3 id="badLocation">Bad location</h3>
		<p>
			If an assistant is unable to find a given user because they have entered a location that is not precise enough, the assistant has the option to mark the user for <em>Bad location</em>. Marking a user for <em>bad location</em> is done by clicking the yellow button with a question-mark on it. The button is found at the same place as the one used to <a href="/#/help#kick">kick</a> a user.
		</p>
		<p>
			The user will then receive a message prompting them to edit their location. The user will then have a red color until they have edited their location.
		</p>

		<h3 id="completion">Completion</h3>
		<p>
			If a user presents a solution to an assistant but is failed and made to change some things about their assignment, the assistant can mark the user for completion.
		</p>
		<p>
			Marking a user for completion is done by clicking the yellow button with a bookmark on it. The button is found at the same place as the one used to <a href="/#/help#kick">kick</a> a user. Once the button is clicked, a window will open up allowing the assistant to add an <strong>optional</strong> comment about what the completion contains. When you are happy with the comment you click <em>Submit</em> to save it. Upon marking a user for completion, the user is automatically kicked from the queue. If a task was added by the assistant, it can be found by <a href="/#/help#readMessages">reading the messages</a> about a user.
		</p>
		<p>
			A user marked for completion will have a yellow color the next time they enter the queue with the intention of presenting.
		</p>

		<h3 id="addMessage">Add message</h3>
		<p>
			An assistant can add a comment about a user in case they think that the next assistant to help that user should know something specific. A possible comment may be <em>"I might have given them too much code"</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			To add a message about a user, click the yellow button with a tag-icon on it. The button is found at the same place as the one used to <a href="/#/help#kick">kick</a> a user.

		</p>

		<h3 id="readMessages">Read messages</h3>
		<p>
			By double-clicking a user in the queue, the administrative options are shown. If the user has some messages connected to them, the magnifying glass to the right will show up in a blue color. If the magnifying glass is gray, that means that no messages exist about the user. Clicking the blue magnifying glass opens a window showing all the messages about the user.
		</p>

		<h3 id="join">Join a queue</h3>
		<p>
			To join a queue, you will first need to find the queue (see <a href="/#/help#findAQueue">Find a queue</a>).
			When you have found the queue, let's say you want to join the queue <em>Allmänhandledning</em>,
			click the queue name.
		</p>
		<img src="/images/allmanhand.png" alt="Allmänhandledning">
		<p>
			You now reach the queue page, where all the queueing takes place. If you are at a KTH computer, your
			location will be automatically obtained.
		</p>
		<img src="/images/location.png" alt="Your location">
		<p>
			If your location is not automatically obtained, please type your location in the location field.
		</p>
		<p>Now click the <em>Join queue</em> button, and you are done!</p>
		<p><em>Note: On the queue list page, the queues you are currently queueing in become blue.</em></p>

		<h3 id="leave">Leave a queue</h3>
		<p>
			To leave a queue, you must first join a queue. If you haven't joined the queue you want to leave,
			we recommend you to not join that queue. If you have already joined the queue you want to leave,
			go to the main page of the queue and click the <em>Leave queue</em> button.
		</p>

		<h3 id="receivingHelp">Receiving help</h3>
		<p>
			Once you have <a href="/#/help#join">joined</a> a queue, you will notice that you are rewarded with a yellow button saying <em>Receiving help</em>, this button should be used if you are receiving help from an assistant who forgot to personally mark you as receiving help. If this is the case, click the button to prevent more assistants to come to you while you are receiving help.
		</p>

		<h3 id="colors">Colors</h3>
		<p>
			When a person is standing in the queue, they may have different colored backgrounds, here are their respective description.
		</p>
		<h4 id="whiteAndGray"><span style="background-color: #E3AF81; color: white;">White</span> and <span style="color: gray;">Gray</span></h4>
		<p>
			White and gray backgrounds indicates that the person is merely standing in the queueand the different colors are only used to make it easier to distinguish between the different rows.
		</p>
		<h4 id="blueStar" style="color: #90C3D4;">Blue <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></h4>
		<p>
			If a preson has a blue star next to their name, that means it is you.
		</p>
		<h4 id="pulsing"><span style="background-color: #E3AF81;">Pulsing</span></h4>
		<p>
			When you see a person that keeps pulsing, that indicates that they are currently receiving help from an assistant.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>
				Note: We do realise that there is no specific color, do not be THAT person ...
			</em>
		</p>
		<h4 id="yellow" style="color: #ECD024;">Yellow</h4>
		<p>
			If you see a person with a yellow background color, that means that the person was previously given a completion and has now come back to present their solution.
		</p>
		<h4 id="red" style="color: #E54932;">Red</h4>
		<p>
			When a person has a red background color, that means that an assistant has told the person that they have to enter a more descriptive location so that the assistants can find the person.
		</p>

		<h3>Queue status</h3>
		<p>
			The queues in Stay A While can have different statuses, which can be good to know.
			The statuses are indicated by the color and style of the queue name.
		</p>
		<table class="table table-striped">
			<tbody><tr>
				<th>Style</th>

			</tr>
		</tbody></table>

		<h3 id="findAQueue">Find a queue</h3>
		<p>
			The first step to queueing would be to find the queue you wish to join, right? So how is that done?
			Well, first go to the <a href="/#/list">Queues</a> page. There you can either scroll to find the queue
			you are searching for, or you could search for the queue. To scroll, just scroll - more info on
			scrolling will not be covered in this help section.

			To search for a queue, type the queue name (or parts of the queue name) in the box that looks like this:
			<img src="/images/find-queues-box.png" alt="Find Queues box">

	</div>
	<!-- Not logged in -->
	<div ng-show="accessLevel < 0" class="panel">
		<h2 style="margin-top: 0;" id="quest">Guests</h2>
		<p>
			You are not logged in. If you only want to view a queue, that's cool,
			but to be able to join a queue, you will need to
			<a href="/#/login">log in</a>.
		</p>

		<h4>Viewing a queue</h4>
		<p>
			If you don't want to log in, you can open up any queue and see the virtual line of eagerly
			waiting people. This is done by clicking the name of the queue you want to look at in the
			<a href="/#/list">Queues</a> page.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, if you want to look at the queue for <em>Allmänhandledning</em>,
			you click like this:
